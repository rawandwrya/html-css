            <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <p class="paragraph one"><b>(1)</b>The bicycle has a history that goes back about 600 years and 
                is quite different than the bike as we know today. Many major 
                innovations have dramatically transformed the bicycle’s form and 
                features over the years. Earlier models had two wheels, 
                but no way to steer, and even required a running start. 
                One at a time, features were slowly developed 
                such as mechanisms to steer, a way to propel the bicycle 
                forward without touching the ground, and system to slow and 
                stop the bike. In the timeline below, we highlight both major 
                milestones for the bicycle as well as smaller innovations that 
                show the evolution leading up to the modern bicycle:
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph two">
                <b>(2)</b>1817 - Steerable Laufmaschine - This machine goes by many names, 
                including the running machine, velocipede, Draisine, and the swift-walker. 
                The wooden steerable laufmaschine has a steerable front wheel and is the first 
                appearance of the two-wheeler principle. 1858 - Pedals - The steerable laufmaschine 
                has pedals added to it. It's unclear who was the first to add these. 
                The credit either goes to Frenchman Pierre Michaux, his son Ernest Michaux, 
                or Pierre Llament. 1863 - Boneshaker - Blacksmith Ernest Michaux invents the 
                first commercially successful velocipede in 1863, which is now called the boneshaker.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph three">
                <b>(3)</b>The boneshaker was made of stiff materials and straight angles which literally made 
                it a “boneshaker” to ride on over common cobblestone roads. 1866 - Penny Farthing - 
                British engineer, James Starley invents the penny farthing which is commonly known 
                as the high wheeler. The penny farthing looks pretty silly compared to modern bicycles, 
                and it was actually pretty difficult to ride. This difficulty limited the popularity of 
                the high wheeler. Makers realized the bigger you make the front wheel, the farther you 
                could travel with one pedal rotation, so wheels continued to become larger.

            <p class="paragraph four">
                <b>(4)</b>These bikes cost an average worker six months worth of pay. 1868 - Rubberized Wheels 
                - Clément Ader is granted the first patent for rubberized wheels. There was still room 
                to improve on ride softness, so rubber tires with an empty core were also tried. 1876 
                - Caliper Brakes - English inventors Browett and Harrison patent an early version of 
                the caliper brake. 1879 - Bicyclette - Henry J. Lawson patents the first rear wheel, 
                chain-driven safety bicycle.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph five">
                <b>(5)</b>Lawson's earlier models were all lever-driven. 1885 - Rover Safety Bicycle - John 
                Kemp Starley invents the rover safety bicycle in England. This is the first model to 
                look like what we now think of as a standard bicycle. This model combines a low seat, 
                strong metal for a chain, and two wheels that are similar in size. 1888 - Inflatable Tires 
                - John Boyd Dunlop patents pneumatic tires in Ireland. These came about when John's 
                young son asked him to find a way to make his tricycle have a softer ride on their 
                common cobblestone streets. Although Dunlop thought he had invented inflatable tires, 
                they had (unbeknownst to him) already been invented by Robert Thomson in 1845.

            <p class="paragraph six">
                <b>(6)</b>1889 - The Pedal-Back Brake - These brakes were patented by Daniel-Stover and William Hance, 
                and would later become known as safety brakes. They also would later become a standard 
                feature on bicycles. 1896 - Coaster Brakes - These brakes allow the bike to move forward 
                without requiring the pedals to move. Additionally, the rider can brake by pedaling backwards.
